## 🌟 Overview

Even the best of us get trapped trying to meet a deadline. When students are working on projects for hackathons, scientific fairs, or classwork, there is a lot of disorganization, which can lead to disputes among teammates, but the deadline doesn't shift. It will remain in place even if no progress is made on the project. Well, fear no more! CrewUp is here to save the day!

The goal of CrewUp is to simplify the documentation and status reporting process for student projects. It aims to provide a centralized platform where students can easily create, update, and share project documentation with their team members and instructors. With CrewUp, students can focus more on the actual work involved in their projects and spend less time on administrative tasks.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the steps to install and run the CrewUp web app locally on your machine.

<br>

### ⚙️ Prerequisites

---

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

<br>

### 📦 Installation

---

To install CrewUp, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TanmayAdithya/CrewUp.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory

   ```bash
   cd CrewUp
   ```

3. Install the required packages and libraries
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

### 🏃 Running Locally

---

To run CrewUp locally, follow these steps:

1. Start the server by running the appropriate command. For example, `npm run dev` to start the development server using Vite. You will recieve a message similar to this:

   [![vite-run-dev.png](https://i.postimg.cc/nhczxsnf/vite-run-dev.png)](https://postimg.cc/Vdp1BkSK)

2. On your device, hold down the `Ctrl` key (Windows) or `Cmd` key (Mac).

3. Left-click on the link to the app. For example, click on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). This will automatically open the app in your default browser.

4. You should now see the CrewUp web app running in your browser.

<br>

> Please note that the actual link and port number may vary depending on your specific setup and configuration.

<br>

### 💡 Additional Information

---

The jspdf package is used for PDF generation in CrewUp. CrewUp is built with React and utilizes the react and react-dom packages. Development dependencies include ESLint and Vite plugins for React. The code formatter used here is Prettier.

That's it! You have successfully installed and set up CrewUp on your local machine. You can now start exploring and working with the web app.

<br>

## 🎯 Usage

Utilising CrewUp is very simple. All you have to do is choose the file you want to download—be it the status report or the documentation—enter your information, click the download button, and presto!

<br>


## 🦾 Challenges

- In the beginning I had no idea what I was doing because this was my first time using React and Vite. React hooks and the JSX format really overwhelmed me. I had spent so much time figuring out how everything worked that I had hardly developed the application's main page.
- I was not confident in my project because the projects of other beginner developers were more advanced in comparison.
- I had to look up several templates for the forms that I would be including in the project, and while doing so, I found challenging to pick one.
- As I was unaware of package.json, I had to create and delete the repo three times and made an unsuccessful attempt to upload node modules to github (wasn't fun).
- It took a long time to import custom fonts into jspdf. I initially gave up, but eventually the issue was resolved, and I'm still shocked at how simple it was.
- ERRORS, ERRORS, ERRORS! I've never seen so many errors in building projects. I was unable to fix a couple of them no matter how hard I tried, which forced me to put some code changes on hold.
- Trying to find out how to divide the text into new lines without having them come out of the document, I went through tutorial hell.
- I wanted to challenge myself this time. I thus attempted to utilise an HTTP request to communicate user data to the backend (which wasn't successful).

<br>

## 💫 Achievements

- I was able to use tools I was unaware of before starting the project to create a minimalistic and functional web application.
- My development abilities were enhanced by building the project consistently over the weeks. It drove me to learn React, JavaScript, and test my Go abilities while also incorporating me to use git.
- I acquired bug-fixing skills by using Google, StackOverflow, and ChatGPT to seek assistance.
